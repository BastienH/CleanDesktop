# Clean Desktop
A Script to Organize Desktop Files into Folders (instead of everywhere)



TODO LIST :

- take the map, but only show the keys and extensions that will be used (based on a first scan of the src dir)
- Check if "Documents", "Videos", etc, already exist (i.e. Windows users)
- enable gui editing of the mapping
- merge Orderer and Clean Desktop
